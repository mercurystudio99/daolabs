			A minor bug has been found in the V2 Juicebox protocol contracts. The contracts have been
			fixed and will be redeployed soon. <b>No funds are in danger</b> and projects are unlikely to be
			affected.

		<p>
			While the current V2 contracts are being deprecated, creating new Juicebox projects has been
			temporarily disabled on the app. Payments to V2 projects with a 0 treasury balance have also
			been disabled.
