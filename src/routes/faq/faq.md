### What is Movement DAO?

Movement DAO leverages Ethereum to enable community Treasuries - instantly form, capitalize and govern with Ethereum, ERC-20 and ERC-721 assets. Collections are powerful content creation tools which enable Treasuries to create products. Treasuries and Collections together are Movements.

### What is a Treasury?

A Treasury is the term that Movement DAO uses when it refers to the project component which receives funds and issues tokens. The Treasury is a set of smart contracts which manage how funds are received, locked, distributed, and managed by the Treasury creators, operators, and token holders.

### What is a Collection?

A Collection is the general term that Movement DAO uses when it refers to a NFT project. The NFT Collection tools allow for the creation of a NFT Collection which accepts user provided media assets, audio, video, image, layers, or source code, and generates the metadata and provides the user with a mint page. Built-in to the NFT Collection is how funds are routed to the Collection owner, including into a Treasury, Split Contract, or individual.

### Treasuries are basically Juicebox Projects?

We forked the Juicebox codebase and have been building [extensions](https://github.com/DAOLABS-WTF/daolabs-contracts/tree/main/contracts/extensions). The core token (or ticket) issuance, redemption contracts have processed over 100m USD. We wanted to create more controls around how tokens are issued, redeemed and how they governed by the holder's membership. Additionally, we focused on building a powerful NFT Collection creator system to provide communities with wider range of fund raising tools.

### What is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?

A DAO is a community-driven entity that operates without a central authority. It functions autonomously and transparently, relying on smart contracts to establish rules and execute decisions. Every aspect of the DAO, including proposals, voting, and code, can be publicly audited. The governance of a DAO is entirely in the hands of its members, who collectively determine crucial aspects like technical upgrades and resource allocations. Typically, community members create proposals and participate in voting to reach consensus. Accepted proposals are enforced by the smart contract. Unlike traditional hierarchical structures, a DAO emphasizes community collaboration, with each member overseeing the protocol to some extent. The framework aligns incentives by encouraging members to vote honestly and approve proposals that benefit the protocol. As the protocol succeeds and gains more usage, the value of the tokens held by DAO members increases, creating a mutually beneficial relationship between protocol success and token holders.

## Re Community and Governance

### Why do I need to issue tokens? How can I issue tokens?

DAOs issue tokens for several reasons. Tokens play a crucial role in the governance, functionality, and incentivization of DAOs.

1. **Governance:** Tokens enable voting rights and decision-making within the DAO. Each token holder typically has voting power proportional to the number of tokens they possess. This allows for democratic decision-making processes, where token holders can participate in proposing and approving changes or upgrades to the DAO's operations.
2. **Incentives:** Tokens serve as an incentive mechanism for participants within the DAO ecosystem. By holding tokens, individuals have a stake in the success of the DAO. They are motivated to contribute positively to the DAO's objectives and are rewarded accordingly. Tokens may also be used to distribute rewards, dividends, or a share of the DAO's profits among its members.
3. **Resource Allocation:** DAOs may utilize tokens to allocate resources effectively. For instance, tokens can represent ownership or access rights to specific resources, services, or features provided by the DAO. Token holders can use their tokens to access these resources or services within the DAO ecosystem.
4. **Fundraising and Investment:** DAOs often issue tokens as a means of fundraising and investment. They can conduct Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) or token sales to generate capital for development, expansion, or other activities. Investors can acquire tokens during these events, effectively becoming part of the DAO community and potentially benefiting from the future growth and success of the organization.
5. **Network Effects:** Tokens can foster network effects within the DAO ecosystem. As more participants acquire and use tokens, the value and utility of the tokens may increase. This, in turn, attracts more users, contributors, and developers, creating a positive feedback loop that strengthens the DAO's ecosystem and its overall value proposition. It's important to note that the specific reasons for token issuance may vary depending on the goals, governance model, and unique characteristics of each DAO.

### What are Ethereum ERC-20 and ERC-721 assets?

The **ERC-20** introduces a standard for Fungible Tokens, in other words, they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) as another Token. For example, an ERC-20 Token acts just like the ETH, meaning that 1 Token is and will always be equal to all the other Tokens.

**ERC-721** is a token standard implemented on Ethereum specifically for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). While Ethereum's native currency is fungible, meaning any unit of Ethereum is replaceable with another, each NFT created under the ERC-721 standard is entirely unique and cannot be replaced by another. The key feature of ERC-721 tokens is their uniqueness, ensuring that each token exists in a one-of-a-kind form. These tokens, commonly referred to as NFTs, have revolutionized the concept of unique digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Initially referred to as "deeds" due to their association with ownership rights, the term "non-fungible token" was adopted by the creators of ERC-721 to encompass the broader range of applications beyond property ownership that NFTs enable.

### Where can I learn more about blockchain, DAOs, and NFTs?

### How are decisions made within a DAO?

Decisions in a DAO are typically made through a decentralized and democratic process involving the DAO's members. Here's an overview of how decisions are commonly made in a DAO:

1. **Proposal Creation:** Any member of the DAO can create a proposal outlining a specific action, change, or decision they want the DAO to consider. This could include technical upgrades, changes to governance rules, resource allocation, or any other matter relevant to the DAO's operations.
2. **Proposal Submission:** The proposer submits the proposal to the DAO's platform or governance mechanism. This can be a dedicated DAO interface, a smart contract, or a decentralized application (dApp) designed for DAO governance.
3. **Proposal Discussion:** Once a proposal is submitted, it is open for discussion among the DAO members. This can occur through forums, chat platforms, or dedicated discussion platforms associated with the DAO. Members can share their opinions, ask questions, and engage in debates to better understand the proposal's implications and potential impact.
4. **Voting:** After the discussion period, a voting phase begins. Each member typically has voting power proportional to the number of tokens they hold, or another metric defined by the DAO's governance rules. Voting can be conducted through on-chain voting mechanisms using smart contracts or through off-chain voting systems integrated with the DAO's platform.
5. **Decision-Making:** The decision on whether to accept or reject a proposal is determined by the voting results. The specific voting requirements, such as the quorum or majority needed for a proposal to pass, are defined by the DAO's governance rules. Once the voting period concludes, the DAO tallies the votes and determines the outcome.
6. **Execution and Implementation:** If a proposal passes the voting phase, the DAO executes the proposed action or decision. This can involve executing smart contracts, allocating resources, implementing changes, or any other necessary steps to implement the approved proposal. The DAO's smart contract code often enforces the execution and ensures the integrity of the decision-making process.

It's important to note that the decision-making process in a DAO can vary depending on the specific governance model and rules established by the DAO. Some DAOs may implement additional mechanisms, such as quadratic voting, delegated voting, or signaling, to enhance decision-making processes and accommodate the preferences of their members.
