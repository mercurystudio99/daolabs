We want to process as little personal information as possible when you use our website. However any transaction you make with the Ethereum smart contracts are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, overtime transactions you make maybe identifiable.

In order to make the application of contributing to projects, we have created a wallet system which allows you to sign-in via existing accounts, such as Gmail, Github, Apple, your mobile phone among other existing online services allows us to create an Ethereum address by which we generate a seed phase. We use multi-party computation in order to generate shards which we make only accessible to you the user. At your option, we backup a single shard to an application service, another shard to a separate service concierge service, which coupled with your shard backed up and accessible only by your login credentials can we allow for you to authorize a restoration of the Ethereum address by which to transfer assets to a new address.

This privacy policy is a placeholder until we have completed the development of the wallet services and will discuss with legal on the specific minimum information we can store in order to provide relevant services to the user at their option.
